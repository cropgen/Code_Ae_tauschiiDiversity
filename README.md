## Repository for scripts and other data analysis protocols for *Aegilops tauschii* diversity project.

1. Run `Tassel5 GBSv2` pipeline using the provided keyfile to call SNPs.
2. Use the `R` scripts to perform a specific analysis.

	* `1.File.formatting.R` - format hapfile for further analyses
	* `2.SNP.Filtering.R` - filter SNPs based on criteria given in the paper
	* `3.PCA_Cluster.R` - plot PCA plots, biplots, and violin plots
	* `4.Genetic.diversity.R` - compute genetic diversity statistics
	* `5_Hybrid_graphical.R` - plot hybrids graphically
